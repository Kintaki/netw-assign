# Hi! My name is Jaimie;

### And I am a student at Conestoga College. 

#### As I am still a student, I have very little to show in terms of real "projects". I do have a few personal endeavors though, the most notable of which include some Dungeons and Dragons type development, and a small video game my friends and I are working on. Here is a picture of a cave system map I developed for the former:

#### If you were to ask me what my best skills were, I'd tell you that I am, first and foremost, good at programming. It is my main subject of interest, and I am quite passionate about it. Other, more practical skills include excellent spatial awareness, critical thinking skills, and decent social ability. I try not to oversell myself though.

#### In the future, I am going to start developing video games; so if you'd like to contact me about this, please email me at jupton7804@conestogac.on.ca! =)
